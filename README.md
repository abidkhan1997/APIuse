**Project Question:**

"Create a dynamic web application that integrates and utilizes data from two different APIs. The goal of this project is to build a user-friendly website using HTML and JavaScript that fetches, displays, and interacts with data from both APIs. Your website should allow users to search for, filter, and display relevant information retrieved from these APIs in a cohesive and intuitive manner. The project should include the following requirements:**

1. **API Integration:** Use JavaScript to fetch data from two distinct APIs. These APIs can provide different types of data (e.g., weather, news, stock market, movie information, etc.).

2. **Dynamic Content Display:** Implement a dynamic interface that updates content based on user interactions. The page should refresh the content displayed without requiring a full page reload, utilizing JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.

3. **User Interaction:** Provide functionalities that allow users to interact with the data. For example, filtering search results, viewing detailed information upon clicking an item, or combining data from both APIs to provide a richer user experience.

4. **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for API requests. Ensure the user is informed if there are any issues with retrieving data or if an API service is temporarily unavailable.

5. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the website is responsive and works well on various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

6. **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation on how the APIs are integrated, including descriptions of the endpoints used, the data fetched, and how the APIs' data is processed and displayed on the website.
